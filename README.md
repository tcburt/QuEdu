# QuEdu
QuEdu is a set of educational materials for quantum physics and quantum information science. At present it is more a collection of scattered learnings than a well-crafted course of coherent study.

QuEdu is a mash of the phrase quantum education and is pronounced `kyoo-ee-dee-yoo'.

## Overview

# Cheat Sheets #
Dense reference information without much derivation or context are the aim of the cheat sheets in this project. They are trifold pamphlets typeset using \LaTeX{} with the `leaflet` package and are constructed from unit files with content expressing a discrete topic.
